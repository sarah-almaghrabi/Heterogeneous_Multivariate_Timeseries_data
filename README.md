# Heterogeneous_Multivariate_Timeseries_data
Welcome to the **Heterogeneous_Multivariate_Timeseries_data repository**! This repository hosts a collection of diverse datasets with multiple time series. These datasets are collected to facilitate the evaluation of heterogenous multivariate time series forecasting models. These datasets are collected to be used for the goal is to determine the models' ability to accurately identify lagged variables importance in heterogenous multivariate time series that include both synthetic nonlinear systems with known dynamics and real-world scenarios.

The folder **data** has the following **Datasets**:
