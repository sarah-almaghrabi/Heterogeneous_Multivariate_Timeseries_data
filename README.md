# Heterogeneous_Multivariate_Timeseries_data
Welcome to the **Heterogeneous_Multivariate_Timeseries_data repository**! This repository hosts a collection of diverse datasets with multiple time series and target time series. These datasets are designed to facilitate the evaluation of models, particularly attention-based models, on synthetic nonlinear systems with known dynamics, as well as real-world datasets. The goal is to determine the models' ability to accurately identify critical characteristics in these systems.
